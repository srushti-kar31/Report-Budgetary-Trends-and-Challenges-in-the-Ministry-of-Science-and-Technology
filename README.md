# Demand for Grants Analysis: Ministry of Science and Technology

## 📌 Project Overview

This report presents a **Demand for Grants Analysis of the Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST), Government of India**, focusing on budgetary allocations, expenditure trends, departmental priorities, initiatives, challenges, and future prospects. The analysis evaluates how financial resources are distributed across the Ministry’s three key departments and how these allocations reflect India’s commitment to science, technology, and innovation-driven development.

The study primarily covers **budgetary data from 2019–20 to 2023–24**, using actual expenditure and demand-for-grants figures.

## 🏛️ About the Ministry of Science and Technology

Established in **1971**, the Ministry of Science and Technology plays a central role in promoting scientific research, technological development, and innovation in India. It operates through three major departments:

* **Department of Science and Technology (DST):** Policy formulation, promotion of emerging areas of science, R&D funding, and human capacity building.
* **Department of Biotechnology (DBT):** Advancement of biotechnology for healthcare, agriculture, environment, and social welfare.
* **Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR):** Promotion of industrial R&D, technology transfer, and strengthening MSMEs through research support.

---

## 💰 Financial Overview

* The Ministry received **₹16,631 crore in 2023–24**, accounting for **approximately 0.36% of the Union Budget**.
* Expenditure increased sharply in **2020–21** due to COVID-19 related research and innovation support.
* A slowdown was observed during **2022–23**, followed by renewed growth in **2023–24**.
* Overall expenditure shows a **long-term upward trend**, indicating increasing importance of science and technology in national planning.

### Key Observations

* **DST consistently receives the highest allocation**, followed by **DSIR**, with **DBT receiving the lowest share**.
* Revenue expenditure dominates over capital expenditure, highlighting a focus on **research programs and institutional support rather than infrastructure creation**.

## 📊 Department-wise Allocation Highlights

### Department of Science and Technology (DST)

* Major heads include institutional research, human capacity building, and assistance to autonomous scientific institutions.
* Moderate growth in administrative and institutional allocations, with fluctuations in innovation and technology deployment funding.

### Department of Biotechnology (DBT)

* Significant funding directed toward biotechnology R&D and autonomous institutions.
* Decline observed in biotechnology research funding in recent years, indicating funding constraints.

### Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR)

* Strong support to national laboratories and CSIR.
* Mixed trends with growth in industrial R&D but a decline in assistance to CSIR in some years.

---

## ⚠️ Key Challenges Identified

* **Low R&D expenditure**: India’s GERD remains around **0.7% of GDP**, significantly lower than global peers.
* **Brain Drain**: Large-scale migration of Indian scientists and researchers to developed economies.
* **Declining private sector investment** in R&D in recent years.
* **Funding gaps** in autonomous institutions and national research bodies.

---

## 🔮 Way Ahead

* Better integration of national initiatives like **Make in India** and **Atmanirbhar Bharat** with science and technology policy.
* Strategic use of **National Research Foundation (NRF)** funds to address long-term funding shortages.
* Increase GERD to **2% of GDP**, as recommended by the Economic Survey.
* Strengthening **Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)** framework to attract domestic and foreign investment in R&D.

## ✅ Conclusion

The Ministry of Science and Technology is central to India’s transition toward a **knowledge-based and innovation-driven economy**. While overall funding has increased over time, the Ministry continues to face challenges related to inadequate investment, uneven allocation, and global competition for talent. Strengthening public and private investment, improving capital expenditure, and fostering innovation ecosystems will be critical for achieving sustainable scientific and technological growth.
